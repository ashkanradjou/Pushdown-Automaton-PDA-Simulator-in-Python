# Pushdown-Automaton-PDA-Simulator-in-Python
This Python code provides a simple implementation of the Pushdown Automaton (PDA) simulator.
PDA is a type of automata that extends the capabilities of finite automata by incorporating a stack and enabling it to recognize CFL languages.

We have defined a PDA simulator class that models the behavior of a PDA and includes functions to check whether a given string is accepted by the PDA or not.
